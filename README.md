# React practices

## React is a javascript library that's used to build user interfaces and is composed of 3 qualities, such as:

1. Declarative:

   -This means that you determine what to do? and not how to do it?. react creates interactive user interfaces in a simple way. Design simple views for each state of your applicatio and will be in charge of updating and rendering efficiently the components when change data.

2. Component-based:

   -create encapsulated components that handle their own state, and convert them into complex user interfaces.

3. Virtual DOM:

   -React offers a virtual DOM. what is it? It is a representation of the DOM in memory that allows React to work on the copy by comparing the virtual DOM with the real DOM (memory cost savings). This avoids rendering the entire page every time there are changes.

if you want to know more about react see the documentation <https://es.reactjs.org/>

## I will show you my practices with:

1. class components and function componentes
2. state and lifecycle
3. Conditional render
4. **Hooks**

   1. useState
   2. useEffect
   3. useContext
   4. useReducer
   5. useCallback
   6. useMemo
   7. useRef

5. EventHandlers and validition of forms
6. Consume APIs: functions with async/await and Context API
7. frameworks of css in react (material UI, bootstrap, bulma, etc)
8. library REDUX using: useDispatch, useSelector, createStore, etc
